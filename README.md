# Administartion portal for the backery project

Coming from React and Angular I have been keen on trying to work with Vue.js for quite a while. 
Now that the time has come to split the Backery Client into 2 different projects / repositories, 
I have taken this as an ooportunity to go and start coding in Vue. 

I also switched to Graphql in this project and will be exploring the Google Analytics API.
